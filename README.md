# Comfy Furniture Provider Marketplace

Welcome to Comy, a furniture provider marketplace built during the Marketplace Builder Hackathon! Comy aims to offer a seamless platform for customers to browse, customize, and purchase furniture, combining elegant design with user-friendly functionality. This project is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS to deliver a modern, scalable, and responsive web application.





## Project Overview


### Day 1: Ideation and Planning

On the first day,  brainstormed ideas for the hackathon and finalized the concept of a furniture provider marketplace. Conducted research to understand competitors and user needs, outlining the core features to include in the project. Additionally, defined the schemas required for managing data, such as products, categories, and created a detailed roadmap to guide development.

### Day 2: Technical Foundation

On Day 2, set up the development environment. We initialized the project with Next.js and TypeScript to ensure type safety and scalability. Tailwind CSS was configured for styling, enabling responsive and consistent design. The system architecture was designed to integrate Sanity CMS as the content management solution, laying a strong technical foundation for dynamic data management.

### Day 3: API Integration

On the third day, focused on populating the Sanity CMS with API data. This was achieved by running custom scripts to fetch and upload data, ensuring that the CMS was pre-loaded with essential information. This integration allowed the dynamic display of products and categories on the frontend.

### Day 4: Building Dynamic Components

Day 4 involved building essential dynamic components, such as Checkout System, Search Bar
,Product Listing and Category Filters Components to display and filter products by categories.


### Day 5: Testing and Optimization

Testing and optimization were the focus on Day 5.Conducted rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs. Automated and manual test cases were created to validate the functionality of the marketplace. Images and assets were optimized for faster load times.


### Day 6: Deployment and Performance Testing

On the final day, Deployed the application using Vercel, ensuring a production-ready environment. Performance testing was conducted using Lighthouse and GTmetrix, optimizing the site for speed, responsiveness, and SEO. Final touches, including documentation and folder structure organization, were completed to wrap up the project.
